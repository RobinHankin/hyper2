\title{Random hyper3 objects}
\description{

  Various random hyper3 objects, in the context of the race metaphor.
  They are intended to be quick \dQuote{get you going} examples of
  simple \code{hyper3} objects.

\usage{
rwinner3(pn,ps)
rpair3(n=5,s=3,lambda=1.3)
rrace3(pn=c(a=2,b=4,c=2,d=1),ps=c(a=0.3, b=0.1,c=0.2,d=0.4))
rracehyper3(n=4,size=9,ps=NULL,races=3)
rhyper3(n=5,s=3,type='race',...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{pn}{A named integer vector showing numbers of each type of player}
  \item{ps}{A named vector showing strengths of each type of player}
  \item{n,size,races,s,type}{Arguments specifying the complexity 
    of the random \code{hyper3} object returned.  See details}
  \item{lambda}{Parameter}
\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{rracehyper3()} or
  \code{rpair3()}}
}
\details{

  These functions return \code{hyper3} objects, as indicated by the
  \code{3} in their names.

  \itemize{

    \item Function \code{rwinner3()} is a low-level helper function that
    takes a player number argument \code{pn}, and a player strength
    argument \code{ps}, and returns the (name of) the winner, chosen
    randomly from a field of runners with appropriate strengths.  It is
    used repeatedly by \code{rrace3()} to select a winner from the
    diminishing pool of still-running players.

    \item Function \code{rpair3()} returns a \code{hyper3} object
    corresponding to repeated pairwise comparisons including a
    white-player advantage.
    
   \item Function \code{rwinner3()} returns a \code{hyper3} support
   function corresponding to repeated pairwise competition, with a white
   advantage represented by \code{lambda}.

   \item Function \code{rrace3()} returns a rank statistic corresponding
   to finishing order for a Plackett-Luce race.  The output can be
   passed to \code{ordervec2supp3()}.

   \item Function \code{rracehyper3()} returns a more complicated
   \code{hyper3} object corresponding to repeated races.

   \item Function \code{rhyper3()} returns an even more complicated
   \code{hyper3} object corresponding to repeated races and pairwise
   comparisons.
}

  File \code{inst/javelin.Rmd} and \code{inst/race3.Rmd} show some
  use-cases for these functions.

  Argument \code{n} generally specifies the number of distinct types of
  players.

\note{
  In function \code{rracehyper3()} [and by extension \code{rhyper3()}],
  if argument \code{n} exceeds 26 and argument \code{pn} takes its
  default value of \code{NULL}, then an error will be returned because
  there are only 26 players, one for each letter \code{a}-\code{z}.

\examples{

rrace3() # moderate-sized default

## pn is player numbers (two "a"s, four "b"s, two "c"s and a "d"):
pn <- c(a=2, b=4, c=2, d=1) 

## ps is player strengths; 'd' is the strongest and the 'b' quadruplets the weakest:
ps <- c(a=0.3, b=0.1, c=0.2, d=0.4)  # player strengths  

rwinner3(pn,ps)              # winner, randomly chosen
rrace3(pn,ps)                 # A random race
ordervec2supp3(rrace3(pn,ps))  # a hyper3 object
rrace3()                        # a hyper3 object for multiple races
