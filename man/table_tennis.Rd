\usage{data(table_tennis)}
\format{
A likelihood function corresponding to the match outcomes listed below.
}
\details{

There are four players, A, B, and C, who
play singles table tennis matches with the following results:

\itemize{
  \item A vs B, A serves, 5-1
  \item A vs B, B serves, 1-3
  \item A vs C, A serves, 4-1
  \item A vs C, C serves, 1-2
}

Object \code{table_tennis} is a \code{hyper2} log-likelihood function
for these observations; \code{S} is the strength of the serving ghost.
Probability vector \code{table_tennis_maxp} is the maximum likelihood
estimate.

These objects can be generated by running script
\code{inst/table_tennis_serve.Rmd}, which includes some further
discussion and technical documentation and creates file
\code{table_tennnis.rda} which resides in the \code{data/} directory.
