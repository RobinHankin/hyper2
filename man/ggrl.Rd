\arguments{
  \item{H}{Object of class \code{hyper2}}
  \item{\dots}{Numeric or character vectors specifying groups of
    players with  equal rank, with higher-ranking groups coming earlier
    in the argument list}
  \item{all_players,winners,losers}{Numeric or character vectors
    specifying competitors.  See details}
  \item{M}{In function \code{rank_likelihood()}, a matrix with each
    row corresponding to a race (or judge).  The columns
    correspond to the finishing order; thus \code{a=M[i,j]} means that
    competitor \code{a} finished in place \code{j} in race \code{i}}
  \item{times}{Vector specifying the number of times each row is
    observed}
  \item{v}{A character vector specifying ranks.  Thus
  \code{c("b","c","a")} means that \code{b} came first, \code{c} second,
  and \code{a} third} 
\item{nonfinishers}{A character vector with entries corresponding to
  competitors who did not finish.  Thus
  \code{race(c("a","b"),c("p","q"))} means that the field is
  \code{a,b,c,d}; \code{a} came first, \code{b} came second and \code{c}
  and \code{d} did not finish}

\details{

  These functions are designed to return likelihood functions, in the
  form of lists of \code{hyper2()} objects, for typical order statistics
  such as the results of rowing heats or MasterChef tournaments.

  Function \code{ggrl()} is an easily-typed alias for
  \code{general_grouped_rank_likelihood()}.

  Function \code{goodbad()} is a convenience function for \code{ggrl()}
  in which a bunch of contestants is judged.  It returns a likelihood
  function for the observation that the members of one subset were
  better than those of another.  Thus
  \code{goodbad(letters[1:3],letters[4:5])} corresponds to the
  observation that \code{d} and \code{e} were put into an elimination
  trial (and \code{abc} were not).
  
  Function \code{elimination()} gives a likelihood function for situations
  where the \emph{weakest} player is identified at each stage and
  subsequently eliminated from the competition.  It is intended for
  situations like the Great British Bake-off and Masterchef in which the
  observation is which player was chosen to leave the show.  In this
  function, argument \code{all_players} is sensitive to order, unlike
  \code{choose_winners()} and \code{choose_losers()} (an integer
  \code{n} is interpreted as \code{letters[seq_len(n)]}).  Element
  \code{i} of \code{all_players} is the \eqn{i^\mathrm{th}}{i-th} player
  to be eliminated.  Thus the first element of \code{all_players} is the
  first player to be eliminated (and would be expected to have the
  lowest strength).  The final element of \code{all_players} is the last
  player to be eliminated (or alternatively the only player not to be
  eliminated).

  Function \code{rank_likelihood()} takes a matrix \code{M} with rows
  corresponding to a judge (or race); column names are interpreted as
  competitor names.  A named vector is coerced to a one-row matrix.
  Each row of \code{M} is an order statistic: thus \code{c(3,4,2,1)}
  means that person 3 came first, person 4 came second, person 2 came
  third and person 1 came last.  Note that in data frames like
  \code{F1_table_2017}, each \emph{column} is a race.

  Function \code{rankvec_likelihood()} takes a character vector of
  competitors with the order of elements corresponding to the finishing
  order; a Plackett-Luce likelihood function is returned.  Thus
  \code{v=c("d","b","c","a")} corresponds to \code{d} coming first,
  \code{b} second, \code{c} third, and \code{a} fourth.  Function
  \code{race()} is an arguably more memorable synonym.

  An example of \code{race()} is given in \code{inst/rowing.Rmd}, and
  examples of \code{ggrl()} are given in \code{inst/loser.Rmd} and
  \code{inst/masterchef.Rmd}.
