  A generalization of the Dirichlet distribution, using a more
  computationally efficient method than the \pkg{hyperdirichlet}
  package.  The software is designed for the analysis of order
  statistics and team games.

  The hex sticker features the \dQuote{draw monster}, a concept
  introduced in Hankin (2020) as a reified entity, representing the
  winner of a drawn chess game.  The character was visualized and
  sketched by my daughter Annabel.  In the chess world, draws are often
  seen as dull and undesirable, and the draw monster embodies this
  sentiment: he is a dampening presence, a metaphorical wet blanket.
  The drawing conveys this lack of fighting spirit well, capturing the
  essence of an uninspired and anticlimactic outcome.
