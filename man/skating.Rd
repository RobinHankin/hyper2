\title{Figure skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics}
\description{
  A likelihood function for the competitors at the Ladies' Free Skate
  at the 2002 Winter Olympics
}
\usage{skating}
\details{

  Three objects 
  \code{skating}, a log-likelihood function for the competitors'
  strengths, \code{skating_table}, an order table for each of the 9
  judges, and \code{skating_maxp}, the result of \code{maxp(skating)},
  which is included to save time in the examples.
    
  These objects can be generated by running script
  \code{inst/skating.Rmd}, which includes some further discussion and
  technical documentation.  The dataset is interesting because it has
  been analysed by many workers, including Lock and Lock, for
  consistency between the judges.

  Note that file is structured so that each competitor is a row, and
  each judge is a column.  Function \code{rank_likelihood()} requires a
  transpose of this to operate.

  Object \code{skating_table} is an order table, taken from Lock and
  Lock.  It corrects what appears to be an error in which judge 5 ranked
  both Butyrskaya and Kettunen 12; there is no 13.  Using EM, I reckon
  that Butyrskaya should be ranked twelfth and Kettunen thirteenth.

\note{There is an (\code{Rbuildignore}-d) discussion of a
  \code{skeleton} dataset in the \code{inst/} directory of the repo,
  it's easy to confuse this with \code{skating}.
