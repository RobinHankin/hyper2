# Overview

The `hyper2` package gives a suite of methods for creating and
analysing likelihood functions generated from a generalization of the
Bradley-Terry probability model.  The package uses the `STL` map class
of `C++` for efficiency; it conforms to `disordR` discipline.

# Installation

The released version of `hyper2` on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org)
may be installed with:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("hyper2")  # uncomment this to install the package
library("hyper2")
```


# Further information

For more detail, see the package vignette; type 

`vignette("hyper2")`

at the R command line.
