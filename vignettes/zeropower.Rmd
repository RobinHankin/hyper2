The powers of a `hyper2` object generally sum to zero.  This is
implicit in Bradley-Terry type likelihood functions in which
probabilities are generally ratios of linear combinations of
strengths.  Here I discuss this observation in the context of `hyper2`
package idiom.  Usually, powers not summing to zero is an indication
of a programming bug.  For example, consider the following likelihood
function, drawn from the `chess` dataset:

\[
\frac{p_1^{30}p_2^{36}p_3^{22}}{
  \left(p_1+p_2\right)^{35}
  \left(p_2+p_3\right)^{35}
  \left(p_1+p_3\right)^{18}
  }
\]


For a time, one package documentation file contained the following
`hyper2` idiom purporting to create the `chess` likelihood function:

```{r appidiom}
chess <- hyper2()
chess["Topalov"] <- 30
chess["Anand"  ] <- 36
chess["Karpov" ] <- 22
chess[c("Topalov","Anand" )] <- 35  # bug!  should  be -35
chess[c("Anand","Karpov"  )] <- 35  # bug!  should  be -35
chess[c("Karpov","Topalov")] <- 18  # bug!  should  be -18
```

However, the above commands include an error [the sign of the
denominator is incorrect].  The package includes two mechanisms to
detect this type of error.  Firstly, the print method (by default)
detects such unbalanced likelihood functions and gives a warning:

```{r showwarningunbalanced}
chess
```

and secondly, function `loglik()` traps nonzero power sums:

```
loglik(equalp(chess),chess)
```

```
## Error in loglik_single(p, H, log = log): sum(powers(H)) == 0 is not TRUE
```

The correct idiom would be

```{r correctid}
chess[c("Topalov","Anand" )] <- -35
chess[c("Anand","Karpov"  )] <- -35
chess[c("Karpov","Topalov")] <- -18
chess
loglik(equalp(chess),chess)
```


See how the print method gives immediate assurance that its argument
is indeed balanced (and besides, unbalanced likelihood functions
cannot even be evaluated with `loglik()`).  It is natural to suggest
including a check in the creation method---`hyper2()`---which would
prevent the creation of a hyper2 object with unbalanced powers.
However, this approach is not consistent with the package; consider
the following situation.  Suppose we wish to incorporate a new
observation into `chess`, specifically that Anand played Karpov twice,
with one win each.  We might proceed as follows:

```{r, newinfo}
chess["Anand" ] %<>% inc
chess["Karpov"] %<>% inc
chess[c("Anand,Karpov")]  %<>% dec(2)
chess
```

However, after the increments but before the decrements, second,
`chess` has a nonzero power sum, pending addition of another term.  At
this point, `chess` is unbalanced; its nonzero power sum is an
indicator that it is a temporary object.  That's OK as long as we
remember to add the denominator (as carried out in the next line)
which would mean dividing by `(Anand+Karpov)^2`, thereby restoring the
zero power sum.  If we forget to do this, the print method gives us a
warning, and indeed `loglik()` returns an error, which should prompt
us to check the coding.

## The print method

The `hyper2` print method is sensitive to option
`give_warning_on_nonzero_power_sum`.  If `TRUE` (the default), a
warning is issued if the powers have nonzero sum.  This is usually
appropriate.  If the option is `FALSE`, the warning is suppressed.
Note that the intermediate likelihood functions in the `chess` example
are not printed (or indeed evaluated), so unbalanced likelihood
functions are permitted, but only ephemerally.

## Function `balance()`

Sometimes it is convenient to accommodate the numerator terms all
together and enforce the zero power sum at the end.  This is
accomplished by `balance()`:

```{r}
H <- hyper2()
H['a'] %<>% inc(5)
H['b'] %<>% inc(2)
H['c'] %<>% inc(9)
H %<>% balance
H
```
