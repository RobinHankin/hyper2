\begin{abstract}

Here a simplification of the Plackett-Luce likelihood functions for
order statistics is proposed.  We consider a field of $n+1$ entities
that are ordered in some way [the preferred example is competitors in
  a running race, ordered by time of crossing the finishing line].
One entity is of particular interest to us: the ``focal entity'', or
focal competitor.  We assign Placket-Luce strength of $a$ to the focal
competitor and $b$ to all others; we require $a+b=1$.  This device
furnishes a reasonable, intuitive, and computationally tractable
likelihood function that I apply to a range of applications including
Formula 1 motor racing and the International Mathematical Olympiad.
The results are difficult to obtain with other methods.

\section{Introduction}

Ranked data arises whenever multiple entities are sorted by some
criterion; the preferred interpretation is a race in which the
sufficient statistic is the order of competitors crossing the
finishing line.  The Plackett-Luce likelihood
function~\cite{luce1959,plackett1975} is a generalization of the
Bradley-Terry model~\cite{bradley1952} in which non-negative strengths
are assigned to each competitor; without loss of generality, if the
finishing order is $1,2,\ldots,n$ and competitor $i$ has strength
$p_i\geqslant 0$, then the Plackett-Luce likelihood function will be
proportional to

\begin{equation}\label{plackettluce}
\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{p_i}{\sum_{j=i}^np_j}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the strengths are normalised so $\sum p_i=1$.
However, estimation of the strengths is somewhat difficult if $n$ is
even moderately large: even with as few as 20 competitors following
Zipf's law~\cite{zipf1949} [a typical assumption for Bradley-Terry
  strengths], Hankin~\cite{hankin2017_rmd} shows that maximum
likelihood strengths identify the correct ranking with a probability
of essentially zero.  The situation is worse in cases such as the
International Mathematical Olympiad, which requires us to consider
over 100 competitors.

Consider a race between a competitor of Bradley-Terry strength $a$ and
$n$ cloned competitors, each of strength $b=1-a$.  An observation is
indexed by~$r$, the number of strength $b$ clones finishing ahead
of~$a$, and because we have $n+1$ competitors $0\leqslant r\leqslant
n$.  The initial field strength is $a+nb=n+(n-1)a$.  The Plackett-Luce
likelihood function~\cite{plackett1975,luce1959} for this situation
would be

\begin{eqnarray}\label{likeforrn1}
  \mathcal{L}_{r,n}(a) &=& 
\frac{b}{a+ n   b}\cdot
\frac{b}{a+(n-1)b}\cdot
\frac{b}{a+(n-2)b}\cdots
\frac{a}{a+(n-r)b}\\ \label{likeforrn2}
&=& \frac{B-1}{(B+n-1)(B+n-2)\cdots(B+n-r-1)}\\ \label{likeforrn3}
&=& \frac{(B-1)(B+n-r-2)!}{(B+n-1)!}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where $B=1/b$.  Note carefully that these expressions are
likelihoods, not probabilities, and do not sum to 1.  Asymptotic
analysis of expression~\ref{likeforrn3} shows that

\begin{equation}
\log\mathcal{L}_{r,n}(a)=\log(B-1)-B\frac{r+1}{n} 
+ K + \mathcal{O}\left(n^{-2}\right)
\end{equation}

Using $\mathcal{S}=\log(B-1)-B\frac{r+1}{n}$ as an approximate support
thus incurs an error of only $\mathcal{O}(n^{-2})$.  Observing that
$\partial^2\mathcal{S'}/\partial B^2=-(B-1)^{-2}<0$, the evaluate
would be unique; we have
$\hat{B}=\frac{n+r+1}{r+1}+\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1}\right)$, or
alternatively $\hat{a}=\frac{n}{n+r+1}$.  I present some numerical
results below.

Previous related work presented the case $n=2$ [in current notation].
Considering the case $n=7$ gives us $7+1=8$ distinct likelihood
functions, Figure~\ref{ninelikes}.  We see an unanticipated asymmetry
between $r$ and $n-r$.  For $r=3$ one might expect that
$\hat{a}=\frac{1}{2}$ on the grounds that the focal competitor's
performance was median.  However, $\hat{a}\simeq 0.64$.

\section{Use-cases}


Formula 1 motor racing is an important and prestigious motor sport
\citep{codling2017,jenkins2010}.  Season ranking is based on a points
allocation system wherein competitors are awarded points based on race
finishing order; points accumulate additively.  The overall
competition winner is the competitor who accumulates the most points
after the final race.  However, as argued by Hankin~\cite{hankin2023},
the drivers' {\em ranks} are statistically sufficient for analysis of

The methods discussed above may be used to assess Bradley-Terry
strengths of Formula 1 racing drivers.  Let us consider 2018 season as
an example and first consider Lewis Hamilton.

Lewis Hamilton is a 


Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon have a long-standing rivalry and
comparisons between them typically compare disparate metrics such as
number of podiums, and highest grid position in a season.
