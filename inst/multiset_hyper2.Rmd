Here we will sum probabilities across a sample space and verify that
the total is constant.  In theory the sum of the probabilities of all
members of the sample space is 1, but in practice [and certainly in
`hyper2` idiom], the likelihood calculation includes an indeterminate
constant which means that all we can say is that the total probability
is not a function of the parameters of the distribution.

Here I present some relatively informal and unstructured thoughts on
this issue from a numerical and `hyper2` perspective.


```{r defineM}
M <- apply(partitions::multiset(c(1,1,2,2,3)),2,function(x){letters[x]})
colnames(M) <- rep("",ncol(M))   # tidier and more compact appearance
M <- noquote(M)
M
```

Above, we use `multiset()` to enumerate the sample space of five
competitors comprising two twins denoted `a`, two twins denoted `b`,
and a singleton `c`.  This document discusses the issue of whether the
twins are identical twins and hence indistinguishable.  Matrix `M` has
${5\choose2\,2\,1}=30$ columns, one per possible result.  We will
calculate the likelihood of each column and sum them to get the
probability of observing any one of the 30 order statistics [the
observations are mutually exclusive, so
$\operatorname{Prob}\left(x_1\cup\cdots\cup x_n\right) =
\operatorname{Prob}\left(x_1\right)+\cdots
+\operatorname{Prob}\left(x_n\right)$]:

```{r definetfun}
tfun <- function(help,strength,M){
  out <- 0
  for(i in seq_len(ncol(M))){
     vec <- M[,i]
     out <- out +
       loglik(strength,cheering3(v=vec,e=c(a=1,b=2,c=3),help=help),log=FALSE)
  }
  return(out)
}
```

```{r showtisconstant,cache=TRUE}
print(tfun(help=(1:3)/10, strength= c(a=0.1,b=0.3,c=0.6),M))
print(tfun(help=(7:5)/22, strength= c(a=0.3,b=0.2,c=0.5),M))
```

Above we see that the sum of the likelihoods is constant.  The value
turns out to be $\frac{1}{1!2!2!}=0.25$.  This is because the
likelihood function (being Plackett-Luce) considers the observation to
be one of the $5!=120$ ways of ordering five distinct competitors.
Matrix `M` has only $\frac{5!}{2!2!1!}=30$ columns, each one of which
corresponds to four different observations, all of which have the same
probability.  Much of the confusion arises from the practice of
identifying a competitor with his strength; we write "$p_a$'' [or
sometimes just "$a$''] to signify both a particular competitor, and
his Bradley-Terry strength.


To explain the factor of $1/4$ discussed above we need some new
notation.  We have five competitors who I will call $\mathbf{do}$,
$\mathbf{re}$, $\mathbf{me}$, $\mathbf{fa}$, and $\mathbf{sol}$.  Now
$p_X$ means "the Bradley Terry strength of $X$''.  The setup here is
that $\mathbf{do}$ and $\mathbf{re}$ are twins, and that $\mathbf{me}$
and $\mathbf{fa}$ are twins (and $\mathbf{sol}$ is a singleton).  We
have that the Bradley-Terry strength of $\mathbf{do}$ and
$\mathbf{re}$ is `a`, the strength of $\mathbf{me}$ and $\mathbf{fa}$
is `b`, and the strength of $\mathbf{sol}$ is `c`.

Consider, for example, the column of `M` reading `a c b b a`.  In
theory, this means the competitor who came first had strength `a`, the
competitor who came second had strength `c`.  So the order statistic
is one of the $2!2!1!=4$ following orders:

$$\mathbf{do}\succ\mathbf{sol}\succ\mathbf{me}\succ\mathbf{fa}\succ\mathbf{re}$$
$$\mathbf{do}\succ\mathbf{sol}\succ\mathbf{fa}\succ\mathbf{me}\succ\mathbf{re}$$
$$\mathbf{re}\succ\mathbf{sol}\succ\mathbf{me}\succ\mathbf{fa}\succ\mathbf{do}$$
$$\mathbf{re}\succ\mathbf{sol}\succ\mathbf{fa}\succ\mathbf{me}\succ\mathbf{do}$$

Above we see that $\mathbf{do}$ and $\mathbf{re}$ come first and last
(or last and first), and $\mathbf{me}$ and $\mathbf{fa}$ come third
and fourth (or fourth and third), while $\mathbf{sol}$ comes second.
All four possibilities have the same probability and all four are
admissible order statistics for the five solfeggio syllables.

But the `hyper2` package [specifically the `loglik()` and
`cheering3()` functions] consider `a c b b a` to mean something
different.  It considers it to be an observation of

$$\mathbf{do}\succ\mathbf{sol}\succ\mathbf{me}\succ\mathbf{fa}\succ\mathbf{re}$$

followed by an identification of $\mathbf{do}$ with (BT strength) `a`,
$\mathbf{sol}$ with strength `c`, and so on.  Any of the four
possibilities above would be equally admissible, and they all have the
same probability.  So to get "real'' probabilities [real in the sense
that summing the probabilities over the columns in matrix `M`], we
have to multiply by four to include all the admissible order
statistics.

The difference between these two interpretations does not matter from
a likelihood perspective as likelihood is defined only up to a
multiplicative constant.


## A more exacting numerical test

```{r,exactingtest,cache=TRUE}
rs <- rp(100,dirichlet(c(a=1,b=1,c=1))) # random strengths
colnames(rs) <- letters[1:3]
head(rs)
f <- function(s){
  jj <- s
  names(jj) <- letters[1:3]
  tfun(help=1:3,strength=jj,M=M)
}
x <- apply(rs,1,f)
```


```{r,plotdifferences}
hist(x-mean(x))
```

Above we see very tight clustering about the mean value of 0.25.
