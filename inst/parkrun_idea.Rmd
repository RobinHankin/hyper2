@paul1995 [page 1401] state that "underdispersion will be seen very
rarely in real-life situations".

@prentice186 [page 322] states that "underdispersed data...may be rare
in applications"

Ranked data arises whenever multiple entities are sorted by some
criterion; the preferred interpretation is a race in which the
sufficient statistic is the order of competitors crossing the
finishing line.  The Plackett--Luce likelihood function
[@luce1959;@plackett1975] is a generalization of the Bradley--Terry
model [@bradley1952] in which non-negative strengths are assigned to
each competitor; without loss of generality, if the finishing order is
$1,2,\ldots,n$ and competitor $i$ has strength $p_i\geqslant 0$, then
the Plackett--Luce likelihood function will be proportional to

\begin{equation}\label{plackettluce}
\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{p_i}{\sum_{j=i}^np_j}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the strengths are normalised so $\sum p_i=1$.  Here we
consider Plackett--Luce likelihood functions in which
$p_i\propto\alpha^{-i}$ for some (generally unknown) $\alpha\geqslant
1$.  The reason for the minus sign is so that, if $\alpha\gg 1$, the
rank of competitor $i$ will be close to $i$.  Sometimes it will be
convenient to parametrize in terms of $\beta=\alpha^{-1}$.

Here, observations are restricted to knowledge of the rank of a single
competitor.  Such observations are common in practice: examples would
include an educational context in which a known number of people
attempt an examination and the only information one actually has is
one's own rank ["you came fifteenth out of a class of 85"]:
confidentiality considerations mean that knowledge of classmates'
performance is censored.  One might complete a foot race and learn
that you placed, say, 194${}^\mathrm{th}$ out of 340 entries.  In this
case the identities and abilities of the other runners are of no
interest.  Other examples might include Formula 1 motor racing, in
which a driver might race in multiple seasons in fields of 22-23:
@hankin2024 notes that Sergio Perez has raced against a total of 73
distinct competitors, rendering conventional Plackett-Luce techniques
intractable.

# Simple cases


### Two competitors {-}
The simplest non-trivial case would be two competitors with strengths
proportional to $1,\alpha^{-1}$, the unit-sum constraint meaning that
the strengths are
$\left(\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha},\frac{1}{1+\alpha}\right)$; these are
the probabilities of competitor 1 coming first and second.

### Three competitors {-}

With three competitors we will do the general case first; let's say
the strengths are $a,b,c, a+b+c=1$.

Competitor $a$ comes first means the order was either $a\succ b\succ
c$ or $a\succ c\succ b$, that is with probability

$$
\frac{a}{a+b+c}\cdot\frac{b}{b+c} + 
\frac{a}{a+b+c}\cdot\frac{c}{b+c}
=\frac{a}{a+b+c}
$$

Competitor $a$ comes second means $b\succ a\succ c$ or $c\succ a\succ b$, that is

$$
\frac{b}{a+b+c}\cdot\frac{a}{a+c} + 
\frac{c}{a+b+c}\cdot\frac{a}{a+b}
$$

Competitor $a$ comes third means $b\succ c\succ a$ or $c\succ b\succ a$, that is

$$
\frac{b}{a+b+c}\cdot\frac{c}{a+c} + 
\frac{c}{a+b+c}\cdot\frac{b}{a+b}
$$


Now the strengths of $a,b,c$ are are proportional to
$1,\alpha^{-1},\alpha^{-2}$ respectively, so they are
$\left(\frac{\alpha^2}{1+\alpha+\alpha^2},\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha+\alpha^2},\frac{1}{1+\alpha+\alpha^2}\right)$.



**Competitor ${\mathbf a}$** comes first with probability
$\frac{\alpha^2}{1+\alpha+\alpha^2}$.  Second with probability

$$
\frac{\alpha(1+2\alpha^2+\alpha^3)}{(1+\alpha)(1+\alpha^2)(1+\alpha+\alpha^2)}
$$

[interesting observation: this has a maximum at $a\simeq 1.35271>1$ of
about $0.3466 > \frac{1}{3}$].  He comes last with a probability of

$$
\frac{1+\alpha+2\alpha^2}{(1+\alpha)(1+\alpha^2)(1+\alpha+\alpha^2)}
$$


**Competitor ${\mathbf b}$** comes first with probability
$\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha+\alpha^2}$.  Second with probability (after
simplification) of

$$
\frac{1+\alpha^3}{(1+\alpha)(1+\alpha+\alpha^2)}
$$

and third with probability $\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha+\alpha^2}$.

**Competitor ${\mathbf c}$** comes first with probability
$\frac{1}{1+\alpha+\alpha^2}$.  Second with probability (after
simplification) of  

$$
\frac{\alpha(1+2\alpha+\alpha^3)}{(1+\alpha)(1+\alpha^2)(1+\alpha+\alpha^2)}
$$


and last with probability

$$
\frac{\alpha^3(2+\alpha+\alpha^2)}{(1+\alpha)(1+\alpha^2)(1+\alpha+\alpha^2)}
$$

\subsection{Park run}

"Parkrun" is a distributed community initiative that organises
weekly timed 5 km runs/walks in parks worldwide~\cite{hindley2020}.  A
typical event will have 200 participants.  Table~\ref{parkruntable}
shows the author has completed a total of 15 parkruns to date, and
from the first pair of numbers we see that 238 runners attended that
particular parkrun, of whom the author placed 173.

\begin{table*}[t]
  \caption{Parkrun results}
\label{parkruntable}
\begin{tabular}{ccccccccccc}
\hline
rank    & 173 & 165 & 172 & 199 & 181 & 229 & 177 & 222 & 206 & 142 \\
runners & 238 & 238 & 196 & 242 & 242 & 318 & 259 & 305 & 297 & 241 \\ \\ \\
rank    & 118 & 224 & 128 & 115 & 183 &     &     &     &     &\\
runners & 179 & 338 & 203 & 245 & 254 &     &     &     &     &\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}


We may consider the author to have an unknown generalized Bradley
Terry strength $a$: Figure~\ref{parkrunsupport} shows a support curve
for $a$ with the evaluate, $\hat{a}\simeq 0.448$ shown.  We also see
two units of support~\cite{edwards1992} shown as a dotted line
illustrating a support interval of about 0.315 - 0.567; we may be
reasonably confident that the author's true BT strength lies in this
range.  In particular, note that a reasonable $H_0\colon
a=\frac{1}{2}$ may not be rejected, the support for $H_0$ being only
susceptible to very minor improvement [$\simeq 0.351$] by moving to
the evaluate.
