Here we analyse results from the men's javelin, 2020 Summer Olympics.

```{r, label=loadjavelinandconvert}
javelin_table <- as.attemptstable(read.table("javelin.txt", header=TRUE))
a <- javelin_table # saves typing
options("bold_personal_best" = FALSE)
javelin_table
```

Above, we see that Chopra threw 87.03 on his first throw, 87.58 on his
second, and so on (all measurements are in meters).  Vadlejch threw
83.98 on his first throw, etc.  Print option `bold_personal_best`
controls whether the personal (row-wise) best attempt is printed in
bold.  This does not work in rmarkdown documents but does work on the
terminal and Rstudio console.  We may convert `javelin_table` to a
named vector with elements being the throw distances, and names being
the competitors:


```{r, label=converttosupp3, cache=TRUE}
javelin_vector <- as.vector(javelin_table)
javelin_vector
o <- javelin_vector # saves typing
```

Above we see that Chopra threw the longest and second-longest throws
of 87.58 and 87.03 respectively;
Vadlejch threw the third-longest throw of 86.67, and so on.  `NA`
entries correspond to no-throws.  It is easy to plot the data in
visual form:

```{r, label=plotjav}
n <- length(levels(as.factor(names(o))))
plot(o, pch=16, col=rainbow(n)[as.factor(names(o))])
legend("topright", pch=16, col=rainbow(n), legend=levels(as.factor(names(o))))
```

Now convert the attempts table to a `hyper3` object, using function
\code{suppfun()}.  However, note that there are two reasonable
interpretations: firstly, we simply ignore no-throws [in the package
docs, these are sometimes referred to as "DNF", or "Did not finish",
following Formula 1 terminology] and to do this we pass
`dnf.last=FALSE`:

```{r, label=dothething2, cache=TRUE}
javelin <- suppfun(javelin_table, dnf.last=FALSE)
javelin_maxp  <- maxp(javelin)
javelin_maxp
```

Secondly, we may treat no-throws as being inferior to any actual
measured throw.  I don't think this is realistic: noone cares about
no-throws and certainly any model in which a thrower with five
no-throws and one excellent throw is given a small strength is
defective.  However, there are some circumstances in which this might
be reasonable [Formula 1 being one example] and this is implemented by
specifying `dnf.last=TRUE`:

```{r,label=dothething1,cache=TRUE}    	   
javelin2 <- suppfun(javelin_table, dnf.last=TRUE)
javelin2_maxp <- maxp(javelin2)
```

Investigation:

```{r, label=plotm}
rbind(javelin_maxp, javelin2_maxp)
pie(javelin_maxp)
pie(javelin2_maxp)
dotchart(javelin_maxp, pch=16)
dotchart(javelin2_maxp, pch=16)
ordertransplot(javelin_maxp, javelin2_maxp)
```

```{r, dothetests, cache=TRUE}
equalp.test(javelin)
equalp.test(javelin2)
```

# Discussion: maximum throw vs Bradley-Terry philosophy

The competition is won by the player who has the longest throw: the
sufficient statistic would be the maximum of the six attempts.
Bradley-Terry cannot handle this if different players have different
variance: short throws are disregarded.

As an example, suppose two throwers have normally distributed
distances; thrower A has a smaller mean distance than thrower B but a
larger variance.  Numerically:

```{r}
set.seed(0)
thrower_A <- round(rnorm(6, 80.2, 2.6), 2)
thrower_B <- round(rnorm(6, 80.3, 1.3), 2)
D <- as.attemptstable(as.data.frame(rbind(thrower_A, thrower_B)))
D
apply(D, 1, max)
```

Above we see that thrower A wins, despite having a smaller mean
distance.


# Some thoughts on quantifying Chopra's dominance

Chopra won the competition by virtue of his longest throw of 87.58
being longer than anyone else's throw.  Observe that his Bradley-Terry
strength is small:

```{r plotjav2, cache=TRUE}
(M <- maxp(javelin))
```

By that criterion, Mardare wins, but not significantly:

```{r testmardare, cache=TRUE}
specificp.test(javelin2, "Mardare", 1/8)
```

It seems that Mardare's consistent performance gives him BT strength,
but not a long longest throw.  How to modify BT to account for this?
	
### Package dataset {-}

Following lines create `javelin.rda`, residing in the `data/`
directory of the package.

```{r,label=savejavelindataset}
save(javelin, javelin2, javelin_table, javelin_vector, javelin_maxp, javelin2_maxp, file="javelin.rda")
```
