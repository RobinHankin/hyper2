# Contributing to `hyper2`

Thank you for considering contributing to `hyper2`!  I appreciate your
interest in making this project better.  Please read and adhere to the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain a safe, welcoming,
and inclusive environment.  Various forms of contributions are
welcome:

- **Bug Reports**: Feel free to report any bugs you encounter.
- **Use cases**: if you use `stokes`, tell me about it!  I want to
  know how the software is being used!
- **Documentation**: Typos, clarity issues, or missing guides: your
  help is welcome here.
- **Feature Discussions/Requests**: Got an idea? Open an issue to
  discuss its potential.
- **Code Contributions**: All code contributions are welcome.


Tests and checks are run on the CI, however locally one can use:
`devtools::test()`.  Ideally each change should be documented.  Major
changes should be `vignettes`.
